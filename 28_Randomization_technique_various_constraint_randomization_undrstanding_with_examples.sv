   Randomization in SystemVerilog - Concept and understanding
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-Randomization is a process of producing random values of the mentioned data type.
-As SystemVerilog also deals with objects, the $random method from Verilog is not sufficient for randomizing an object.

 //////////////////////////    
  Need for Randomization :
 //////////////////////////      
 -With increasing complexity of the design, there are high chances to have more bugs in the design when it is written for the first time. 
 -To verify DUT thoroughly, a verification engineer needs to provide many stimuli. 
 -There can be multiple cross combinations of variables in a real system. So, it is not possible practically to write directed cases to verify every possible combination. 
 -So, it is very much required to have randomization in the verification testbench.
      
///////////////////////////////      
  Advantages of Randomization:
///////////////////////////////      
 -It has the capability of finding hidden bugs with some random combination.
 -Constraint-based randomization provides possible random values instead of a complete random range.
 -It provides flexibility to have random values based on user-defined probability.
 -SystemVerilog randomization provides flexibility to disable randomization for a particular variable in a class as well as disable particular constraints based on the requirement.
 -It saves time and effort in verification instead of writing a test for every possible scenario.
